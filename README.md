# Manufacturing_Analysis

# Project Overview
The Manufacturing Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of production metrics and quality control indicators within a manufacturing environment. By leveraging data visualization techniques and analytics, the dashboard offers valuable insights into various aspects of production, rejection rates, departmental performance, and machine costs.

# Insights
1. Item-Level Analysis:
Breaks down manufactured and rejected quantities for each item.
Allows for targeted improvements by identifying specific product line issues.

2. Quarterly Trend Identification:
Visualizes production and rejection trends over quarters.
Enables quick identification of seasonal patterns and areas for optimization.

3. Wastage Percentage Monitoring:
Tracks wastage percentage to minimize losses.
Identifies areas for improvement and guides waste reduction strategies.

4. Delivery Period Tracking:
Monitors quantity produced and delivered per period.
Ensures timely production and delivery alignment with targets.

5.Monthly Production Visualization:
Displays monthly production quantities for trend analysis.
Facilitates capacity planning and decision-making for better efficiency.
